### General Purpose and Description of the Project
In this project, I go through the data analysis process.  
I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib and Seaborn which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!  
##### Purpose  

With this project I wanted to achieve some personal goals, such as:  
- Be familiar with all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce plots showing my findings  

##### Description

Three pieces of dataset were downloaded from [Gapminder](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gapminder.org/data/&sa=D&ust=1532469042121000) on 19/06/2021.  
1. Name: *Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)*  
Description: Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 prices, PPP based on 2011 ICP).  
2. Name: *Population, total*  
Description: Total population.  
3. Name: *Population density (per square km)*  
Description: Average number of people on each square km of the land in the given country.  
The data can be accessed from the abovementioned website, by searching the name of the respective dataset in the *search* field

### Credits

I activelly used the following resources:
- I used advices from [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com). Those were priceless.
- Multiple articles on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-guide-to-beautiful-visualizations-in-python-f564e6b9d392) made my visualisations look **a lot** nicer
- And also python official documentation
